# Mathematica_Projects

This repository contains Mathematica notebooks that were written by me for my dissertation at UC Riverside. My Physics PhD was in theoretical particle physics. In particular I studied dark matter phenomenology. My dissertation is titled "Constraining Dark Matter with Astrophysical Systems".

My first publication in the Physical Review D journal was on the halo dynamic constraints placed on a model of inelastic self-interacting dark matter: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11114. This paper used the calculations from the InelasticSIDMCalcOpt.nb notebook and its variants. 

My second publication in the same journal was on the effects of a central black hole on the dark matter density and the physical observations that are a consequence of this effect: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15050. This paper used the calculations form the BlackHoleDensitySpike.nb notebook and its variants. This paper also models the the Milky Way and M87 galaxies using the MW_M87.nb notebook.

My third paper (coming soon), submitted for publication in the same journal, is on the heating of Neutron stars from inelastic dark matter scattering. For this paper I collaborated with other physics post-docs and graduate students. This paper utilized the notebook calculations from my first paper and I also checked the work of a junior graduate student with the DirectDetectionCheck.nb notebook and its variants as well as the ElectronScattering.nb notebook.
